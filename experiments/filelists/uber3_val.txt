/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-133.wav|Now here is the basic rule that I have when it comes to federal education.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-139.wav|whether it's parochial schools or whether it's private schools or whether it's charter schools,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-140.wav|but in any case, if the federal government is to be involved in the business of education, certainly it has a stake in people not learning false history and pseudo history.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-141.wav|And history directly designed to undermine the foundations of the United States,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-146.wav|Okay. He is correct about this. This is toxic stuff, suggesting that America has no foundational principles, which is what C R T says,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-148.wav|It's disgusting. And it destroys the country.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-156.wav|In other words, we want to shift how Americans think about America. Dramatically.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-160.wav|Okay. So Trump continued, he said it is child abuse to teach critical race theory to kids.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-161.wav|This is one hundred percent true again.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-163.wav|The systems are out to get you. There is no greater act of viciousness you can visit upon a child than teaching a child that no matter how hard you work you are bound for failure.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-164.wav|That is a vicious thing to teach a child. I have three children.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-176.wav|The minute you say patriotism to the left, that the fact that the word patriotism is anathema to the left should tell you something about what the left believes about the country.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-180.wav|Hitler youth trended yesterday on Twitter, because he said that he thinks that Americans should be patriotic about the country and that kids should be taught to be patriotic about the country. Hitler youth.|2

I mean, there are wildfires and hurricanes and pandemics and riots. I mean, it's a good time, time out there, but you do need life insurance.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-195.wav|Policy genius. When it comes to insurance, it's nice and important to get it right, be a responsible human being. Go get life insurance right now at the best competitive price.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-197.wav|Okay, so Trump yesterday calls for patriotic education. This should not be controversial.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-199.wav|It's it, it, frankly, I think that, that you have to be mentally deficient to believe otherwise, that that American children should be taught that the country that they inhabit is good,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-206.wav|She tweeted out, trump just announced, he will soon be signing an executive order, establishing a quote national commission to promote patriotic education called the seventeen seventy six commission.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-207.wav|It is unclear what that means, but he has been trashing the sixteen nineteen project, which aims to educate the nation with facts.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-208.wav|No, the sixteen nineteen project is a pseudo historical piece of garbage. Historians agree on this.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-216.wav|Instead, what they want is an unending litany of America's evils.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-222.wav|Like, really? Donald Trump is going to sit there and write? The same people who believe that Donald Trump has no attention span, is an idiot.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-227.wav|I don't think you want to have that argument. I think what you actually want is to force the federal government to sponsor and subsidize your anti-American bull crap.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-250.wav|Okay. So I, I will say that calling the left on their B S is extraordinarily fun to watch.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-261.wav|This is all cowtowing to a particular narrative, so people will leave them alone. It is so that they can buy the allegiance of the wokesters in the media.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-297.wav|Or that if they are racist, it's not manifesting in actual mistreatment of black people, it's just kind of out there.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-303.wav|This is, this is the, the only reason I have ever seen for the department of education, not to be abolished. That is that this is the only reason in history.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-304.wav|So good, good. Honestly, this is, by the way, this should be your tactic in everyday conversations.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-311.wav|You've literally said that racism is unalterable. It is a facet of being white in America.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-315.wav|Or if you do take them seriously, then go ahead and take them literally and ask them to prove their own racism. Should be a fun conversation?|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-332.wav|We'll get to that in just one second. First is that glorious time of the week. When I give a shout out to a daily wire member.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-338.wav|By the way, if you're watching on YouTube on September twenty eight, all of my shows contents will be moving to my channel. youtube dot com slash ben Shapiro.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-340.wav|There will still be content on the daily wire channel, but my daily show will be on my channel.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-354.wav|Alrighty. So Joe Biden had a town hall last night. So I remember a couple of nights ago.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-358.wav|So Joe Biden does a town hall on C N N and he has not asked a single really difficult question during the entire time.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-360.wav|Now understand that Joe Biden's entire campaign is I'm a nice old ca, codger.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-363.wav|And I mean, let's face it. We've had two presidential candidates in the last thirty years who have literally physically fallen over.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-364.wav|I mean, Bob Dole fell off a stage in nineteen ninety six and then Hillary Clinton fell into a van in two thousand sixteen. So it could happen.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-370.wav|And the reason that it was brilliant and wonderful and edifying is of course, because it was in fact Joe Biden talking and the fact that he was not asked like a single difficult question, that's normal.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-380.wav|Still. Joe Biden does this town hall last night and it gets awkward.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-381.wav|So for example, he was asked specifically about the green new deal. He randomly lost his train of thought in the middle of the answer and talked about ventilating schools, which is a weird thing to do.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-383.wav|t's not a green, new deal thing. He just loses track in the middle. And there's a lot of this.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-384.wav|And he was asked by a woman who was a farmer about overregulation. His answer was something having to do with chicken bleep in Delaware.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-393.wav|but it was on the side of the road and I picked it up and I said to corn pop, why is there poop in my leg hair?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-395.wav|That man is going to be our president for thirty two point seven seconds before Kamala Harris is the president of the United States.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-397.wav|This is the way that Joe Biden does it. He's asked specifically about the radical policies of his own party.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-398.wav|And then he says he backs them, but I've also provided an alternative plan that's not quite as radical.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-400.wav|Okay. You can't have it both ways. If he backed the green new deal, you want ninety three trillion dollars in new spending.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-402.wav|Okay. And then he, uh, was asked about China and he was repeatedly asked whether he'd called China and opponent. He would not.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-423.wav|See the thing about being in power when there's a massive pandemic, Is that pretty much every game, everybody gets shellacked.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-424.wav|Or at least they should be if the media weren't completely full of it.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-425.wav|Right? Apparently Andrew Cuomo escapes all censure despite the fact that his state got just reamed.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-426.wav|Apparently the the governor of New Jersey gets away with it, even though his state got absolutely creamed.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-428.wav|He said that, uh, the virus is costing us, our freedoms. Well, actually right now it's lockdowns that are costing us our freedoms, not the virus itself.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-432.wav|Then he proceeded to hold in-person rallies up until the first week of March. March!|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-435.wav|Joe Biden actually made the claim yesterday that if Trump had done his job, every single human being who has died from COVID would still be alive.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-442.wav|And yesterday bar gave a speech talking about, uh, at Hillsdale college, talking about the D O J,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-444.wav|So let's actually play the clip of bill BARR. So you get the full context as to what he's saying here.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-454.wav|Seems like a restriction on Liberty. Also. He deliberately did not compare it to slavery.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-455.wav|He explicitly took slavery and put it to the side. And so Joe Biden who apparently doesn't speak English or is wildly dishonest or both, is like, no, he was comparing it to slavery.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-462.wav|Here's Politico's tweet. If A B C's event with president Trump was an icy grilling, C N N's drive in conversation with Joe Biden yesterday was more like an affable reunion of old acquaintances.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-463.wav|Yeah, no bleep. And that is pretty damned obvious. Affable acquaintance between old, old friends.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-473.wav|Do you trust, do you trust the doctors who you've been lighting votive candles to?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-474.wav|For months at this point, here's Joe Biden talking down vaccines.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-486.wav|The division between red States and blue States on COVID has been pushed by the media and pushed by the Democrats since the very beginning.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-487.wav|Ron de Santis was evil for not shutting down Jacksonville beaches.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-494.wav|It was Democrats who immediately went to red States are mishandling this and blue States, they were saying that while ron De santis  had no cases in Florida.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-496.wav|And by the way, out of the top eleven places in the United States, including D C, deaths per million, I believe eight of them are blue just for the record.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-508.wav|But here's, Jim's Cliburn suggesting that Trump just allowed people in blue States to die. Oh, well, if you say so, James.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-510.wav|And so a national strategy would have forced States that were not being hit to shut down, which would have been very silly.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-511.wav|You should not shut down States that don't have any cases.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-513.wav|There's a story yesterday that I think actually is probably the most damaging story that I've seen on the Trump administration's handling of COVID, is from business insider,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-518.wav|Uh, I've been saying that since the beginning, do the social distancing and wear the mask so we can reopen and get back to normal.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-520.wav|And in fact, that's kind of what happened in places like Florida and Arizona and Texas and Georgia, and the masking rate went up as the virus went up.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-529.wav|And it's about leading off what are called the asserya mechuva, which are the ten days of repentance.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-534.wav|Why is that an important idea? Well, it's an important idea for a variety of reasons.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-537.wav|It doesn't mean that man is completely disconnected from the animal world.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-539.wav|This is why when people say, you know, that the earth would be better off without us, what does the earth care, the are the, the earth has no sentience.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-544.wav|God's creation of the universe culminates with man. See, there's something beautiful about the biblical story of creation.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-549.wav|They don't have their own separate day of creation, right? God creates the animals and it creates human beings at the very end of the sixth day,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-550.wav|meaning that we are innately, wrapped up in our own animal instincts, but we have the capacity to look up to the stars.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-558.wav|And atheists will say, well, you know, If you run the same game over and over and over, then eventually you come up with life.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-560.wav|And so if there are an infinite number of universes, then every possibility is possible in every universe.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-563.wav|And that is something that is worth noting.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-569.wav|Now, put aside sort of the religious arguments for a second. What is the value of believing on a human level that God created the universe?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-571.wav|You also tend to believe in things like objective truth. That outside of you, there is a truth.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-587.wav|It doesn't mean that God looks like human beings.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-588.wav|What it means is that God created us with the ability to reason. God created us with the ability to create.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-597.wav|Just like you have responsibilities to your parents. You have responsibilities to the one who created us. Who gave us a mind to comprehend the universe around us.|2
