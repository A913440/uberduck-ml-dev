/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-86.wav|And to say, well, you know, that was universal, but what's unique about America is American slavery.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-94.wav|And that's really what is going on here. So unfortunately the sixteen nineteen project is now being taught in a lot of public schools.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-105.wav|Or to the pre United States  since the U S didn't exist yet. It's the British colonies in, in Virginia.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-107.wav|When I say there's a gap between people who want to disintegrate American history and people who believe in American history,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-110.wav|They suggested that when he said that Americans should be taught to be patriotic about the greatest country in world history, which they should be,|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-130.wav|Okay. So yesterday president Trump gives the speech on constitution day in which he says we need to stop teaching critical race theory and sixteen nineteen project nonsense.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-133.wav|Now here is the basic rule that I have when it comes to federal education.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-135.wav|The reason I believe this is because the same federal department of education capable of telling the States to teach good history is similarly capable of telling the States to teach quite bad history.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-141.wav|And history directly designed to undermine the foundations of the United States,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-150.wav|Any country that hopes to survive has to share a philosophy, has to share a history, has to share a culture.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-159.wav|She is just, she's awful. And the fact that they made her the de facto editor of the New York times demonstrates where our media are at and where the far left are at, or the mainstream left, I should say at this point.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-167.wav|First of all, I can't tell my kids that because it's an overt lie, but beyond that, it is, it is an act of deep abiding immorality to teach people that they are victims of systems they cannot see,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-179.wav|Online, as soon as Trump said patriotic education, people st,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-185.wav|but first with everything going on right now, you may be wondering whether you can get life insurance. I mean, there are wildfires and hurricanes and pandemics and riots. I mean, it's a good time, time out there, but you do need life insurance.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-187.wav|You could save fifteen hundred bucks or more per year by using policy genius to compare life insurance policies.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-198.wav|Of course, Americans should believe America is good. How this is in any way controversial is absolutely beyond me.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-202.wav|There's a huge cadre of Americans who believe that children in America should be taught that the country is evil and must be torn down to the root.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-216.wav|Instead, what they want is an unending litany of America's evils.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-217.wav|And the underlying argument being that all of those evils are a direct result of America's constitutional governmental system and the false principles of the declaration of independence.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-218.wav|This is the argument that is taking place.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-221.wav|I said, do you think that Donald Trump is actually going to sit there and write the curriculum?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-224.wav|Alternatively, he will have exactly what he said he will have, a national commission that takes a look at educational standards and says,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-226.wav|That's a good thing. Again, you want to make the argument on a systemic level, the federal government should not control educationm I'm with you. Let's do it.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-234.wav|And by the way, they would be right. Especially when you're talking about pseudo historical nonsense.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-237.wav|We'll get to that in just one second.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-249.wav|when you get involved, dial pound two, five, zero, say keyword Ben Shapiro to get started with pure talk USA today.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-250.wav|Okay. So I, I will say that calling the left on their B S is extraordinarily fun to watch.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-254.wav|So we will acknowledge our own racism. We will provide, we will do the malice struggle sessions, where we announce our own guilt and that, and thus, we shall have alleviated our guilt and we have reestablished our moral bone of fighters.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-259.wav|Of course that, there's not one of these major corporations whose leadership truly believes that America is deeply and inherently systemically racist, that their company is deeply systemically racist, or that capitalism is bad.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-267.wav|The argument on systemic racism is not the same as the argument that racism still exists.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-271.wav|And the United States ranks super high on the list of people who are comfortable living with somebody of a different race next door.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-273.wav|Okay. In any case. The argument is not about racism. It's about structures of racism, structural racism, a term, institutional racism.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-277.wav|So it's just early stage Ibrahim X Kendi.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-294.wav|You say that all of your institutions are shot through with racism. Well, you know, that's illegal in the United States.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-305.wav|When someone says America's systemically racist, you should say to them, are you a racist?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-316.wav|And meanwhile, Joe Biden got the softball treatment from C N N, who could have predicted. Who could have predicted.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-317.wav|We'll get that in just one second. First, let's talk about sleep quality. So, last night, I go to bed.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-321.wav|That is why it is indeed so soft. Because they work with family owned mills all over the world to expertly weave every set of boland branch sheets with the highest levels of craftsmanship.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-333.wav|Today, it is amateur M M A fighter bang, bang, Sandy Chang on Instagram who understands the need for proper hydration.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-334.wav|After a grueling workout. In the pic, Sandy is donning her purple belt and gi while proudly clutching the world's finest and most elite beverage at vessel.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-341.wav|So I'm telling you if you don't want to miss it, you need to like pause what you're doing right now. It takes five seconds.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-343.wav|We're making room for some new exclusive content over on daily wire, but, I'm also making a lot of new content you can only find on the channel belonging to me!|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-355.wav|Donald Trump had a town hall on A B C and it basically amounted to George Stephanopoulos asking him why he's a bad orange mean man.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-356.wav|And then a bunch of members of the audience were undecided in that they were undecided whether to vote for Bernie Sanders as a write-in or undecided whether to vote for Joe Biden.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-358.wav|So Joe Biden does a town hall on C N N and he has not asked a single really difficult question during the entire time.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-363.wav|And I mean, let's face it. We've had two presidential candidates in the last thirty years who have literally physically fallen over.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-365.wav|I mean, it could happen. I'm not hoping for it. You want everybody to remain healthy, but Joe Biden is obviously not cognitively with it.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-370.wav|And the reason that it was brilliant and wonderful and edifying is of course, because it was in fact Joe Biden talking and the fact that he was not asked like a single difficult question, that's normal.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-379.wav|So the media have now justified their own failure of journalisming by suggesting in true journalismic fashion that they really can't ask questions to Joe Biden that are tough because Joe Biden is just too wonderful a human being.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-383.wav|t's not a green, new deal thing. He just loses track in the middle. And there's a lot of this.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-391.wav|And he's like, let me tell you about this time. I saw it on the side of the road.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-393.wav|but it was on the side of the road and I picked it up and I said to corn pop, why is there poop in my leg hair?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-407.wav|Trump won in twenty twump, if he wins, it'll be because of the Russians in twenty twenty. Which country is more powerful and has more propagandistic arms in the United States?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-410.wav|Here is Joe Biden saying that he won't call the Chinese an opponent.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-412.wav|They're actively subjecting formerly free States like Hong Kong to, to abject tyranny.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-413.wav|They are, they are clearly attempting aggressive action in the South China sea directed at Japan and Taiwan.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-431.wav|But according to Joe Biden, it's only the virus. The virus is the only reason why we're locked down, not actual formal lockdowns in many, many States, including California, where literally half of the unemployed now live.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-432.wav|Then he proceeded to hold in-person rallies up until the first week of March. March!|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-434.wav|At no point did anybody do any of that stuff. This revisionist history whereby Democrats just don't exist in the narrative is truly incredible.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-437.wav|You are making that up! There is no evidence that that is the case. None!|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-438.wav|If the president had done his job since the beginning, you held rallies until March, ya doof!|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-441.wav|Then of course, Joe Biden jumped on it, William Barr. So William Barr is the attorney general of course.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-444.wav|So let's actually play the clip of bill BARR. So you get the full context as to what he's saying here.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-458.wav|Here. Like other than, here's a really bad thing that's happening.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-460.wav|That is not me saying the two things are equivalent, it's me deliberately disassociating the two things, ya morons.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-463.wav|Yeah, no bleep. And that is pretty damned obvious. Affable acquaintance between old, old friends.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-465.wav|Meanwhile, I do love the, the democratic take on COVID, which again is the focal point of their campaign.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-468.wav|And if you distinguish between red and blue and you're a Republican, you are also extremely bad. So that is the line right here.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-472.wav|Whose AB, who's absolute task. Do you trust Redfield? Do you trust Fauci? Do you trust Birx?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-473.wav|Do you trust, do you trust the doctors who you've been lighting votive candles to?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-478.wav|When you say you don't trust the vaccine as long as Trump is in office, what you really mean is you don't trust the vaccine until Trump is out of office, right?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-485.wav|But let's be real about this.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-493.wav|I'm the one who's been saying since the beginning that you should follow the actual recommendations of people who are, who are examining the data.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-497.wav|Here is Chuck Schumer saying that Trump is monstrous and demented for distinguishing blue States, which is weird because I'm old enough to remember when the Democrats were saying that all the red States were monstrous and demented for even opening.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-498.wav|The Atlantic ran a headline about Georgia saying that it was Brian Kemp's experiment in human sacrifice to reopen Georgia.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-499.wav|Here is uh Chuck Schumer. The American lives don't count. No one did that.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-508.wav|But here's, Jim's Cliburn suggesting that Trump just allowed people in blue States to die. Oh, well, if you say so, James.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-513.wav|There's a story yesterday that I think actually is probably the most damaging story that I've seen on the Trump administration's handling of COVID, is from business insider,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-522.wav|But again, the, the, the notion that Democrats would have handled this tons better, I'm, I'm, I'm waiting to see any evidence of that at all, at all, at all at all.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-528.wav|Uh, and then you sort of make resolutions for the new year. The Jewish new year is about two things. It's about celebrating God's creation of the universe.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-531.wav|And, and the idea here is that you have basically, uh, on the repentance side, you have ten days to sort of demonstrate to God that you would like to fix your problems.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-535.wav|First of all, it means that man is central to the universe.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-546.wav|And two, it reminds human beings that they are everything.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-549.wav|They don't have their own separate day of creation, right? God creates the animals and it creates human beings at the very end of the sixth day,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-558.wav|And atheists will say, well, you know, If you run the same game over and over and over, then eventually you come up with life.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-562.wav|The fine tuning of the universe for human life is indeed proof that something wants, something wants us to be here.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-566.wav|There didn't have to be a winner in the lottery. Whenever there's a lottery, you assume there will be one winner.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-569.wav|Now, put aside sort of the religious arguments for a second. What is the value of believing on a human level that God created the universe?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-576.wav|That doesn't mean that the way you adapt is true, it means that you adapt in the most adaptable way.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-586.wav|I've said this before the single most important verse in the Bible is that God created human beings in his image.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-589.wav|And that we owe each other recognition that we are each made in God's image.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-591.wav|You can't mistreat somebody if you believe that they are made in the image of God.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-596.wav|Now what that means in the end, and this is how it connects to, to the ten days of repentance is that we do have responsibilities to the one who created us.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-598.wav|He did that so that we could seek truth and act morally.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-599.wav|God created us with a moral sense, right? This is the kantian statement that the best evidence of God is the starry heavens above and the moral sense within.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro-603.wav|lie in the basic idea that God created the universe and that's what we're celebrating here on Rosh Hashanah.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-3.wav|First, a reminder. You're spending way too much money on that cell phone bill, like, hundreds of dollars a year. Too much money on that cell phone bill.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-7.wav|By the way, Pure Talk is the top rated wireless company by Consumer Affairs. They've got the absolute best customer service team based right here in the United States.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-23.wav|So let's talk about that for a second. So there've been a bunch of studies on what authoritarianism actually looks like.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-25.wav|He was a Frankfurt school member. He's a Marxist theorist. And he wrote a book about authoritarianism.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-30.wav|And there was a Harvard social scientist named Robert Altemeyer. He created a right-wing authoritarianism scale. He was attempting to detect three particular character traits.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-37.wav|Okay, well, it is very clear at this point there is left-wing authoritarianism and, in fact, social scientists have found that left-wing authoritarianism is quite common.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-38.wav|When University of Montana social psychologist, Lucian Conway, created a scale to mirror Atemeyer's scale, what he found is that the highest score for authoritarianism was for liberals and liberals had the highest score for authoritarianism.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-50.wav|Top-down censorship directed at group authority, right?|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-52.wav|Right, this is the diversity training you see it inside your corporations or as we will see Democrats in Congress, trying to shut down free speech.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-64.wav|They know they can't pass a law that abridges freedom of speech or it'll get struck down by the Supreme Court.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-66.wav|This is the new model, not top-down censorship just from government, but top-down censorship.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-67.wav|With government actors using as a cudgel, their power, in order to beat corporations into submission.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-72.wav|That was an opportunity for the authoritarian left to get the upper hand in American discourse because free speech is now bad. Free exchange of ideas is now bad. It could be incitement.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-73.wav|If you say something they don't like, it could be dangerous. And so, now is a great time to shut down free speech, to shut down individual rights and to use all powers that they have at their disposal in order to do so.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-74.wav|I'll explain in just one second, because again, the fact that this is, is happening in the United States should scare the living hell out of everybody who believes in individual rights, right, left or center.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-78.wav|Then finally, they're going to tell you that they have to order the part online, and then they're going to upcharge you for it. Instead, here is something you could do. You could just skip the middleman.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-79.wav|Why not just go to rock auto dot com? It's much easier than walking into the store and people demanding quick answers and then, ordering the part online. Instead, just go to rockauto.com and get the part yourself.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-87.wav|Okay. So these two members of Congress have now issued a series of letters.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-91.wav|And there are a variety of games they play in order to shut down and stuff they don't like. You'll notice one of the things that they've done, and this is a pretty clever, slight of hand.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-95.wav|The only reason we lost that election is because of Russian disinformation.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-105.wav|So they've now shifted over from fringe sort of issues when it comes to speech.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-107.wav|Which they then term,  misinformation. And then, they set up a whole body of fact-checkers,|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-109.wav|And this is what you see at PolitiFact. PolitiFact will label Barack Obama statement that if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Half true for several years and then only later will they be like, oh yeah, that was the lie of the year.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-119.wav|And misinformation is really kind of like disinformation. And disinformation is something that the government can fight. So really your speeches is like Russian disinformation.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-121.wav|And it is tied into an ideology that suggests revolutionary aggression against the system because the system of individual rights is inherently discriminatory, according to the woke left.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-125.wav|And this is the language that you hear from the left.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-129.wav|And it's becoming more dominant every day. So here's this letter from these two members of Congress, again, directed at taking down political opponents. Here's a letter to John Stanley, Stankey rather.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-131.wav|Our country's public discourse is plagued by misinformation, disinformation, conspiracy theories, and lies. Look at that. Look at the conflation there.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-134.wav|And lies, well, I mean, the left lied throughout the summer that America's police are systemically racist. They don't seem to care about that lie very much.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-149.wav|That's not true. Lots of things are said in American public discourse every day. And we have laws against things like slander and libel.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-162.wav|And then there are some that is wheat and it is your job to distinguish between the two.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-165.wav|Well, I mean, if they say so, then that. Wow. I mean, amazing how they came to that conclusion. It's just the right-wing media ecosystem that's susceptible to disinformation, lies, and half-truths.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-173.wav|That, that apparently is the sort of offense that you'd get Newsmax taken off A T and T. However, C N N, which overtly promoted riots in the middle of the summer.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-174.wav|I mean, Chris Cuomo went on television and he said, where does it say in the constitution that protest is supposed to be peaceful?

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-205.wav|That's dangerous stuff. That's authoritarian stuff. That's top-down censorship and full authoritarian, leftist mode. So here's what these Congresspeople say. Remember, this is a letter to the head of A T and T.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-210.wav|Again, Congress cannot pass a law restricting freedom of speech, but members of Congress can pressure companies like A T and T into restricting freedom of speech.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-328.wav|Alright. Meanwhile, Joe Biden did a commemorative event for five hundred thousand American lives lost to COVID-nineteen. Obviously that is a massive tragedy. Every one of those lives lost is indeed a tragedy.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-336.wav|In fact, there are good studies to show that sympathy is useful in politics because it allows you to think about a wide variety of people who are not you, but empathy is actually a problem.|2
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-351.wav|If people are saying that you should go out and you should congregate with other people, and there's no risk of COVID, if you, without vaccination or anything, and that you should not wear a mask and not socially distance.

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-364.wav|Well, we don't care about that. All we care about is that Joe Biden is a caring person. He cares about you. Here's the thing.|2

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/uberduck/ben-shapiro/wavs/benshapiro2-372.wav|When we all know that this is precisely the opposite. But again, you have to promulgate the notion that Joe Biden is full of empathy,|2
