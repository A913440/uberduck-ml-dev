/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0140.wav|The arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that Oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming involved|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0177.wav|For the first time|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0187.wav|There is, of course, no way to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that time.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0218.wav|Thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to Irving on Thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely,|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0240.wav|Many factors were undoubtedly involved in Oswald's motivation for the assassination, and the Commission does not believe|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0242.wav|It is apparent, however, that Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0087.wav|Absolute security is neither practical nor possible. An approach to complete security would require the President|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0088.wav|to operate in a sort of vacuum, isolated from the general public and behind impregnable barriers.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0090.wav|Any travel, any contact with the general public, involves a calculated risk on the part of the President and the men responsible for his protection.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0091.wav|Such risks can be lessened when the President recognizes the security problem,|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0129.wav|The total volume of information received by PRS has risen steadily.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0165.wav|Most of these cases involved persons who used threatening language in communications to or about the President.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0005.wav|Oswald was known to other Federal agencies with which the Secret Service maintained intelligence liaison.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0058.wav|Agent Fain retired from the FBI in October 1962, and the closed Oswald case was not reassigned.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0065.wav|This information led Hosty to review Oswald's file, from which he learned that Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0073.wav|Hosty considered the information to be, quote, stale, unquote, by that time, and did not attempt to verify Oswald's reported statement.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0078.wav|and Hosty asked the New Orleans FBI office to determine Oswald's address and what he was doing.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0084.wav|and his application was approved on the following day.|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0088.wav|We did not request the State Department to include Oswald on a list which would have resulted in advising us of any application for a passport|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0106.wav|Oswald, quote, was probably making a self-serving statement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing this literature, and for no other reason,|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0107.wav|and when I got to questioning him further then he felt that his purpose had been served and he wouldn't say anything further, end quote.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0168.wav|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0206.wav|suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.|0

/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0221.wav|The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service|0
/mnt/disks/uberduck-experiments-v0/data/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0234.wav|It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.|0
